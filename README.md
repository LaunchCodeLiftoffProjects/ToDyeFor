# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

ToDyeFor will be the best place for professional textile designers as well as DIY creators to go to figure out dye calculations for their projects and to share their dye recipes, tips and techniques with the world.

ToDyeFor is a web application that allows surface designers and textile artist calculate, search, create and keep track of dye recipies.  The idea came from working  for 5 years in a small surface design studio where all the recipes and fabric swatches were recorded and calculated by hand and stored in binders and bins. Needless to say it could be unorganized at times and lead to lost recipies, incorrect calculations and wondering where this bautiful scrap of fabric came from and how to replicate it.  ToDyeFor aims to remove the headache of keeping track of dye recipies, incorrect calculations, and searching for a desired recipe.

### Features

User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.

Calculator: Users will be able to calculate a dye recipe using ...

Search: Users will be able to search for dye recipes based on color and depth of shade ...

Create Account: Users will be able to create an account on the site...

Create Post: Users will be able to create new recipe posts when logged in. New posts will appear in the userâ€™s profile. Posts will contain text and photos.

Save recipes?

 * **Image upload**:  Account holders will have the option to upload a photo of a fabric swatch for a finished dye recipe.
 * **Public Dye Calculator**: Users will be able to input dye type and fabric ammount to calculate needed weights for chemicals and dye in a recipe. 
 * **Search Recipies by Color, Fabric, and Dye**: Users will be able to search for dye recipes made by account holders accourding to tags of color, fabric, and dye.
 

### Technologies

* HTML & CSS
* JavaScript
* C#
* ASP.NET
* MongoDB

### What I'll Have to Learn

dye calculations, account creation, password storage, validation, image upload and storage, tagging

We will have to learn how to have a user upload an image and have it stored in a database that can be searched.  To do this we will probably have to use MongoDB so we will need to learn how to work with a new database.  To create the Dye Calculator we are considering creating it with JavaScript we will need to brush up on JavaScript skills to make it interactive. We are considering using JS as our front end so we will need to learn how to incorperate JS into the front end and have C# work with MongoDB for the back end.
