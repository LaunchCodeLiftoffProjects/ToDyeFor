# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an “elevator pitch” for your project. This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?

ToDyeFor will be the best place for professional textile designers as well as DIY creators to go to figure out dye calculations for their projects and to share their dye recipes, tips and techniques with the world.

### Features

### Technologies
What languages and technologies will you use to build your application?
MongoDB, ASP.net
HTML, CSS, Javascript

### What I'll Have to Learn
In the course of building your project, you’ll have to learn something new. Perhaps you want to use data from a public API, or add a bit of JavaScript to make your front-end more interactive. If you can’t name the exact technology or technique that you’ll have to learn, you should still be able to describe a problem that you have identified that you don’t currently know how to solve.
dye calculations, account creation, password storage, validation, image upload and storage, tagging
